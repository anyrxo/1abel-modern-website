## 2. LOGO & BRANDING SYSTEM

### 2.1 Logo Variations

1ABEL uses a **three-tiered branding system** that balances visibility with minimalism:

#### **PRIMARY LOGO: "1" Icon with Hidden "ABEL"**
- **Description**: Stylized numeral "1" with the letters "A-B-E-L" integrated/hidden inside the vertical stroke. When you look closely, you can see "ABEL" vertically embedded within the "1" shape - so it reads as "1ABEL" in a clever unified mark.
- **Use Case**: Main embroidery logo for visible branding
- **Dimensions**: 15mm width x 45mm height (standard), 8mm x 25mm (small)
- **Colors**: Tone-on-tone (fabric color) OR 1 shade darker for texture
- **File Formats Required**:
  - Vector: AI, EPS (for embroidery digitization)
  - Raster: PNG with transparency (300 DPI)
- **Embroidery Specs**:
  - Stitch type: Satin stitch for clean lines
  - Thread: Rayon (luxury sheen) or Polyester (durability)
  - Backing: Light tearaway stabilizer
  - Density: 4-5mm stitch length
- **Design Note**: The "ABEL" letterforms should be subtle/integrated into the "1" shape - discovered upon close inspection, not immediately obvious from distance

#### **SECONDARY LOGO: "1" Micro Mark (Minimal Version)**
- **Description**: The same "1" icon with hidden "ABEL" inside, but rendered at ultra-small scale (minimal branding)
- **Use Case**: Ultra-minimal branding placement (Alo Yoga style subtlety)
- **Dimensions**: 3mm width x 12mm height (micro size) OR 2mm width x 8mm height (ultra-micro)
- **Placement**: Chest left (5cm from center), sleeve hem, back neck, hip
- **Embroidery Specs**:
  - Fine single-column satin stitch (ABEL details may not be visible at this scale - becomes abstract "1" shape)
  - Thread matches fabric exactly (invisible until close inspection)
- **Design Note**: At this micro scale, the "ABEL" integration becomes almost imperceptible - it reads as a simple vertical mark from distance, but those who know will recognize the "1" shape

#### **TERTIARY LOGO: "1ABEL" Wordmark**
- **Description**: Clean sans-serif typography, all caps
- **Use Case**: Woven labels, interior tags, leather patches
- **Typography**: Custom sans-serif (similar to Futura Bold)
- **Dimensions**:
  - Woven label: 50mm x 15mm
  - Leather patch: 40mm x 30mm debossed
- **Woven Label Specs**:
  - Material: 500+ thread count damask
  - Weave: Satin weave for premium feel
  - Edge: Ultrasonic cut or folded
  - Attachment: Center-fold sewn into back neck seam

### 2.3 Thread Color Specifications

#### **Arc 2 Shadow - Thread Colors:**
| Fabric Color | Hex Code | Thread Color (Pantone) | Thread Shade |
|--------------|----------|------------------------|--------------|
| VOID (Pure Black) | #0a0a0a | Pantone Black C | Exact match |
| STEEL (Dark Grey) | #3a3a3a | Pantone Cool Grey 11 C | 1 shade darker |
| BLOOD (Burgundy) | #4a1a1a | Pantone 504 C | 1 shade darker |
| MOSS (Forest Green) | #1a2a1a | Pantone 5535 C | 1 shade darker |
| EARTH (Brown) | #2a1a0a | Pantone 4975 C | 1 shade darker |

#### **Arc 3 Light - Thread Colors:**
| Fabric Color | Hex Code | Thread Color (Pantone) | Thread Shade |
|--------------|----------|------------------------|--------------|
| CLOUD (White) | #ffffff | Pantone Cool Grey 1 C | 1 shade darker (off-white) |
| SAKURA (Pink) | #ffd4e5 | Pantone 706 C | 1 shade darker |
| MIST (Soft Blue) | #d4e5ff | Pantone 2707 C | 1 shade darker |
| SAND (Cream) | #f5f0e8 | Pantone 7527 C | 1 shade darker (light tan) |
| LILAC (Lavender) | #e8d4ff | Pantone 2635 C | 1 shade darker |

**Thread Material Recommendation:**
- **Rayon**: Luxury sheen, soft hand-feel (premium choice)
- **Polyester**: Durable, colorfast (practical choice)
- **Cotton**: Matte finish (organic/sustainable option)

**Recommendation:** Use **Rayon** for all Arc 2 Shadow and Arc 3 Light products to maintain premium aesthetic.

- **2 Points**: Defect 3-6 inches
- **3 Points**: Defect 6-9 inches
- **4 Points**: Defect > 9 inches
- **Pass Standard**: < 20 points per 100 yards

**Common Defects to Flag:**

- Color streaks, uneven dyeing
- Slubs (thick spots in yarn)
- Barre (horizontal streaking in knits)
- Pilling (after wash test)

### 7.2 Construction Quality

**Stitching Standards:**
- **Stitch Count**:
  - Lightweight fabrics (tees): 12-14 stitches per inch
  - Medium fabrics (hoodies, sweats): 10-12 stitches per inch
  - Heavy fabrics (denim, canvas): 8-10 stitches per inch
- **Stitch Type**: Lockstitch for seams, coverstitch for hems (knits), flatlock for activewear
- **Thread Tension**: Balanced (no puckering, no loose threads)
- **Seam Strength**: Minimum 30 lbs breaking strength

**Common Construction Defects:**
- Skipped stitches
- Puckering or gathering
- Crooked seams (>5mm deviation)
- Loose threads (trim all loose ends)
- Misaligned patterns or panels

### 7.3 Fit Sample Approval Process

**Step 1: Pre-Production Samples (PP Samples)**
- Manufacturer submits 1 sample per style in size M (medium)
- 1ABEL checks:
  - Measurements vs size chart (± 1cm tolerance)
  - Fabric hand-feel and weight
  - Color accuracy
  - Construction quality
  - Logo placement accuracy

**Step 2: Size Set Samples (SS Samples)**
- After PP approval, manufacturer submits full size run (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- 1ABEL checks:
  - Grade consistency (measurements scale correctly)
  - Fit across different sizes
  - Final approval before bulk production

**Step 3: Top of Production Sample (TOP Sample)**
- First finished unit from bulk production line
- Final check before full production run begins

### 7.4 Color Matching

**Standards:**
- **Tolerance**: ΔE < 1.5 (very tight, ensures consistency)
- **Lighting**: Color approval under D65 daylight simulator (6500K)
- **Batch Consistency**: All pieces in same production batch must match within ΔE < 0.8

**Color Fastness Testing:**
- **Wash Fastness**: ISO 105-C06 (Grade 4+ required)
- **Light Fastness**: ISO 105-B02 (Grade 4+ required)
- **Crocking (Rub Fastness)**: ISO 105-X12 (Grade 4 dry, Grade 3+ wet)

### 7.5 Wash and Wear Testing

**Mandatory Testing:**

- **Pilling Resistance**: ISO 12945 (Grade 3+ after 5,000 rubs)
- **Seam Slippage**: ISO 13936 (max 6mm slippage under 30 lbs force)
- **Colorfastness to Washing**: ISO 105-C06 (Grade 4+ required)

**Testing Protocol:**
1. Wash sample 5 times (domestic wash, 30°C, tumble dry low)
2. Measure shrinkage (length and width)
3. Check for pilling, color fading, seam integrity
4. Pass/Fail: If any test fails, reject batch

### 7.6 Final Inspection (AQL Standards)

**Acceptable Quality Limit (AQL):**
- **Critical Defects**: 0% (holes, major color defects, broken zippers)
- **Major Defects**: 2.5% (crooked seams, minor stitching issues, small stains)
- **Minor Defects**: 4.0% (loose threads, slight color variation within tolerance)

**Sampling Plan (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4):**
- Sample size based on lot size
- Example: Lot of 1,000 units = inspect 80 units randomly
- If defects exceed AQL, reject entire lot

**Final QC Checklist per Garment:**
