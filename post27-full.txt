<h2>The 1ABEL Fit Philosophy: Modern Comfort Meets Intentional Silhouette</h2>
<p>Fit is the most important variable in how clothing looks and feels. A perfectly fitted $50 piece will always look better than a poorly fitted $500 piece.</p>

<p>At 1ABEL, we design for <strong>modern, relaxed fit</strong>—a middle ground between restrictive slim fits and shapeless oversized trends.</p>

<p><strong>Our fit philosophy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comfort without sacrifice:</strong> Garments should move with you, not restrict you, but still maintain clean lines and intentional silhouette</li>
<li><strong>Contemporary proportions:</strong> We avoid both 2010s skinny fits and 2020s oversized trends—our fit remains relevant across years</li>
<li><strong>Layering-ready:</strong> Every piece is designed to layer (base layers under mid layers, mid layers under outer layers)</li>
<li><strong>Shoulder fit priority:</strong> Shoulders are anatomically determined—we get this right so the rest of the garment falls correctly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What this means in practice:</strong></p>
<p>Our tees have slightly relaxed chest (not tight, not baggy), standard sleeve length (hits mid-bicep), and length that hits at mid-fly on pants. Our hoodies have room through the chest for layering over tees or thermals, with sleeve length that allows for pushed-up sleeves without bunching.</p>

<p>You won't find extreme cropped lengths, exaggerated oversized fits, or body-hugging compression. Our fit is timeless, versatile, and functional.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fit is permanent. Trends are temporary. We design for the former.</p>

<h2>Regular Fit vs. Relaxed Fit: Understanding the Difference</h2>
<p>We offer two fit categories across most products: <strong>Regular Fit</strong> and <strong>Relaxed Fit</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Regular Fit (Contemporary):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Versatile everyday wear, clean silhouette, wearing as outer layer</li>
<li><strong>Chest:</strong> Follows natural body shape with 2-3 inches of ease (not tight, not loose)</li>
<li><strong>Shoulders:</strong> Seam sits at natural shoulder point (anatomically correct)</li>
<li><strong>Length:</strong> Tees hit mid-fly on pants, hoodies hit mid-thigh</li>
<li><strong>Sleeve:</strong> Tees hit mid-bicep, hoodies hit wrist bone when arms relaxed</li>
<li><strong>Who it's for:</strong> Most body types, those who prefer clean, contemporary fit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> 5'10", 170 lbs, athletic build → Medium Regular Fit across all tops</p>

<p><strong>Relaxed Fit (Layering-Focused):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Layering, comfort priority, slightly oversized aesthetic</li>
<li><strong>Chest:</strong> 3-5 inches more room than Regular Fit (comfortable, not baggy)</li>
<li><strong>Shoulders:</strong> Slightly dropped (1/2 inch past natural shoulder point)</li>
<li><strong>Length:</strong> 1-2 inches longer than Regular Fit</li>
<li><strong>Sleeve:</strong> 1/2 inch longer, allows for sleeve push-up without bunching</li>
<li><strong>Who it's for:</strong> Those who layer frequently, prefer looser fit, taller builds</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Same person (5'10", 170 lbs, athletic) → Large Relaxed Fit for hoodies to layer over Medium tees</p>

<p><strong>When to choose Regular vs. Relaxed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base layers (tees, thermals, longsleeves):</strong> Regular Fit for most people</li>
<li><strong>Mid layers (hoodies, crewnecks):</strong> Regular Fit if wearing as outer layer, Relaxed Fit if layering under jackets</li>
<li><strong>Outer layers (puffers, overshirts, denim jackets):</strong> Relaxed Fit for layering over hoodies</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Measure Yourself: The Complete Guide</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are critical for online sizing. Here's how to measure yourself correctly:</p>

<p><strong>Tools needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Soft measuring tape (fabric, not metal)</li>
<li>A well-fitting garment you already own (for reference)</li>
<li>Mirror (to check tape placement)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1. Chest (for tops):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stand with arms relaxed at sides</li>
<li>Wrap tape around fullest part of chest (usually at nipple line)</li>
<li>Keep tape parallel to floor, snug but not tight</li>
<li>Breathe normally, measure on exhale</li>
<li>Round to nearest half-inch</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comparison method:</strong> Lay your best-fitting tee flat, measure pit-to-pit (armpit to armpit), multiply by 2. This is your preferred chest measurement.</p>

<p><strong>2. Shoulder width (for tops):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stand naturally (don't force shoulders back)</li>
<li>Measure across back from one shoulder point (where shoulder meets arm) to the other</li>
<li>Tape should follow natural curve of upper back, not pull straight across</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comparison method:</strong> Lay your best-fitting tee flat, measure from shoulder seam to shoulder seam across the back.</p>

<p><strong>3. Body length (for tops):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stand straight, measure from high point shoulder (where neck meets shoulder) down to desired hem length</li>
<li>For tees: typically mid-fly on pants (28-30 inches for most people)</li>
<li>For hoodies: typically mid-thigh (30-32 inches)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comparison method:</strong> Lay your best-fitting tee flat, measure from high point shoulder (back collar seam) straight down to hem.</p>

<p><strong>4. Sleeve length (for tops):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arms relaxed at sides, slightly bent</li>
<li>Measure from shoulder point down to wrist bone</li>
<li>For short sleeves: measure to mid-bicep</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comparison method:</strong> Lay garment flat, measure from shoulder seam along outside of sleeve to cuff.</p>

<p><strong>5. Waist (for bottoms):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Measure around natural waist (narrowest part of torso, usually 1-2 inches above belly button)</li>
<li>Keep tape snug but not compressing skin</li>
<li>Don't pull stomach in—measure your actual waist</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comparison method:</strong> Lay your best-fitting pants flat, measure waistband across, multiply by 2.</p>

<p><strong>6. Inseam (for bottoms):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Measure from crotch seam straight down to desired hem length</li>
<li>For joggers: typically ankle (30-32 inches)</li>
<li>For jeans/cargos: depends on break preference (no break = 30-31", slight break = 32-33", full break = 34-35")</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comparison method:</strong> Lay your best-fitting pants flat, measure from crotch seam to hem along inseam.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Write down these measurements and keep them saved. Compare to our size charts on each product page.</p>

<h2>Between Sizes? Here's How to Choose</h2>
<p>If your measurements fall between two sizes, use this decision framework:</p>

<p><strong>For base layers (tees, thermals, longsleeves):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size down if:</strong> You prefer fitted silhouette, wearing as outer layer (no layering over it), between sizes closer to smaller size</li>
<li><strong>Size up if:</strong> You prefer relaxed fit, plan to layer over it (overshirt, jacket), between sizes closer to larger size</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For mid layers (hoodies, crewnecks):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size down if:</strong> Wearing as outer layer (no jacket over it), prefer fitted look</li>
<li><strong>Size up if:</strong> Layering under jackets/puffers, prefer room to move, want to layer thick base layers underneath</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For outer layers (puffers, overshirts, denim jackets):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size up (default recommendation):</strong> Outerwear is designed to layer over hoodies/crewnecks, so sizing up ensures proper fit with layers</li>
<li><strong>Size down only if:</strong> You plan to wear over tees only (no hoodie), want a more fitted outer layer look</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For bottoms (joggers, cargos, denim):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size down if:</strong> Waist is closer to smaller size (elastic waistband has adjustability)</li>
<li><strong>Size up if:</strong> Waist is closer to larger size, you prefer more room in thighs/seat</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> When in doubt for layering pieces (hoodies, outerwear), size up. It's easier to adjust fit with layers underneath than to squeeze into a too-small garment.</p>

<h2>Common Sizing Questions Answered</h2>

<p><strong>Q: I'm usually a Medium in most brands. Am I a Medium in 1ABEL?</strong></p>
<p>A: Probably, but measure to confirm. Our Medium fits true to size for contemporary fit, but some brands run small (fast fashion) or large (vintage/streetwear). Compare your measurements to our size chart.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How much do 1ABEL garments shrink?</strong></p>
<p>A: Minimal shrinkage (1-2%) if you wash cold and air dry. Our heavyweight cotton is pre-shrunk during production. Hot wash + hot dry can cause 3-5% shrinkage (we don't recommend this).</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I return if sizing doesn't work?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. Check our returns policy on the website. We accept returns within 30 days if unworn/unwashed.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Should I size up for heavyweight fabrics?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. Our sizing accounts for heavyweight fabrics (200+ GSM tees, 400+ GSM hoodies). True to size means true to size.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I'm 6'2" and most brands are too short. Will 1ABEL fit?</strong></p>
<p>A: Check length measurements on product pages. Our Large and XL have longer body lengths (29-31" for tees, 28-30" for hoodies). If you need extra length, size up or check "Tall" options if available.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I'm 5'6" and most brands are too long. Will 1ABEL fit?</strong></p>
<p>A: Our Small and Medium work for shorter builds. Check inseam on bottoms—joggers have elastic cuffs that stack cleanly, denim can be hemmed by a tailor for $10-15.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Bottom Line: Measure, Compare, Choose</h2>
<p>Sizing is straightforward if you follow the process:</p>

<p><strong>3-step sizing process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Measure yourself:</strong> Chest, shoulder, length, waist, inseam (5 minutes)</li>
<li><strong>2. Compare to size chart:</strong> Check product-specific measurements on product page</li>
<li><strong>3. Choose based on fit preference:</strong> Between sizes? Size up for relaxed/layering, size down for fitted</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Our sizing philosophy:</strong></p>
<p>We design for modern, versatile fit that works across body types and use cases. Shoulders are anatomically correct, chest has 2-3 inches of ease, lengths are contemporary. No extreme cropping, no exaggerated oversizing, no restrictive slim fits.</p>

<p>The result: garments that fit well, layer seamlessly, and remain relevant across years.</p>

<p><strong>Start with 1ABEL's fit-tested basics:</strong> Premium tees in Regular Fit (clean silhouette), heavyweight hoodies (layering-ready), modern straight denim (versatile fit). Every piece is designed to fit correctly and last 5-10 years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect fit is personal. Measure, compare, and choose what works for your body and style. We provide the data—you make the decision.</p>
